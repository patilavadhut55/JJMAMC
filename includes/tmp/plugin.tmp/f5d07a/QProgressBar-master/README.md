QProgressBar
============

QProgressBar plugin for QCubed was once upon a time an animated progress bar for jQuery. It was based on the mootools progressBar by webappers. Now, it is, by popular demand, some funky	multi-colored progress bar that starts with a THX intro and launches jQuery fireworks when it hits 100%. No not really. Check it out though!


This control is a wrapper for original idea at: http://t.wits.sg/jquery-progress-bar/
