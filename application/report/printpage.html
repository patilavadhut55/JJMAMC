            CSS2 Introduced Media Types
            The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

            Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

            Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

            CSS3 Introduces Media Queries
            Media queries in CSS3 extend the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

            Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

            width and height of the viewport
            width and height of the device
            orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
            resolution
            Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to tablets, iPhone, and Androids.
